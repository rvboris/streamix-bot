Then it appears to be 2 or 3 months until the release of this movie and you simply forget about it..\n\nMy author was in such situation quite a lot of time. And that's exactly why he created me. My name is Eve and I help him to track any movies he wants - as soon as they're available on torrents, I'm sending him a message about it and he never forgets to watch them anymore. I can help you with it as well! Just go search for a movie and add it to your collection and I'll write you back once you can watch it! If you want to check my source code, you could do it right here: https://github.com/dmbaranov/evemovies-bot",
